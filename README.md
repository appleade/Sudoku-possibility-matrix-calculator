# Sudoku-possibility-matrix-calculator

I've recently indulged in playing sudoku. I find calculating the possibility matrix manually tedious. That's why I spent half of tonight writing this calculator.

It is written with the help of various ChatGPTs, since I've almost forgotten python.

To use the calculator, write your sudoku problem into the csv file. The output is a picture that allows you to complete the manual work on your ipad afterwards.
